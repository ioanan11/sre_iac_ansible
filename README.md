# Ansible

## What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management (CM) and application deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. Ansible is AGENTLESS, temporary connecting remotely via SSH or Windows Remote Management to do its tasks.

### Use case: When we launch an EC2 instance on AWS, for example, we need to click a lot of things in order to set the instance up. By using Ansible and IaC we could have a script of instruction to do these steps -> Automation. 

### Benefits
- Open-source (free, a lot of documentation available)
- Efficient
- Powerful
- Agentless (no need to install other software or separate management structure)
- Simple to set up

## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
IaC manages and provisions the infrastructure through code instead of manual processes. This makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations.
